# School-Management-System
This repository is for my School Management System that I have done for a project in my University for the Database System course.

In order to use this project you need to install XAMPP and create folder School in htdocs folder so that you can use localhost to test this application. Then you need to add this files to School folder and also you need to create database called schoolmanagement and add .sql file that I have given.
